Set in Wuhai, a sin-soaked cross between Hong Kong, Las Vegas, and New York City, a uniquely independent, maritime metropolis, situated on the coast of the Masursky Bay, and surrounded on all other sides by The Expanse: Mars' vast, red deserts.

Ecological collapse played a major role in the destruction of Old [Earth](/docs/bsetting/earth), and now, the manufactured climate of Mars hangs in a perpetually perilous state. [The Red Sea](/docs/bsetting/theredsea), the restored ancient oceans and their closely monitored ecosystems, along with vast networks of Climate Control towers, sustain life on the planet. Mars is Humanity's last and only chance of survival. Best not fuck it up.
