## Crew Archetype

Regardless of the focus of the game, the player characters are assumed to be part of a team.
 
In theory, this could be anything, but its recommended to pick something that places the Characters in the position of **Underdogs**, on the bottom rung of society, with a reason to hate the status quo.

Discuss and determine with the GM a **Crew Archetype** that you're excited to explore, or roll **1d12** on this list:

#### Archetypes
| 1d12 | Archetype                          | Example Triggers                                                         |

| 10   | Detectives and Bounty Hunters      | Interrogation, Spot a lie, Follow a Lead, Gun handling                   |
| 11   | Nomads and Outcasts                | Pack Tactics, Survival, Mechanics, Navigation, Road Warrior, Shared Code |
| 12   | Rockstars and Performers           | Put on a Show, Evade the Law, Rile up an Audience, Stick it to the Man   |

If your group is more divided, consider the connections between player characters. What are they to each other?

If its a little vague, or the characters don't really know each other yet, either write a broad descriptor of what the group currently is (Drifters, Freelancers, Nobodies, etc.), or just skip this. Do a few jobs and come back to it.

Playing to the **strengths (Triggers)** of your **Archetype** earns you **Reputation** (or "Rep") at the end of a job. As your Reputation increases, your crew gain additional benefits. See Crew Advancement below.

---

## Heat
**Heat** represents how likely your enemies are to make a move against you.

**Heat** is displayed as a Track, split into groups of three, every **three ticks** your Retribution Rating increases. As your Retribution increases, the events and complications you'll face during downtime become more severe. See [Downtime](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement#events--retribution).

### Gaining Heat
Heat is gained at the end of a job, depending on a number of factors:
- **Noise:** If the job was loud and chaotic, gain **+1 Heat**.
- **Evidence:** If the Crew were identified, or left behind a trail of evidence linking back to them, gain **+1 Heat**.
- **Profile:** If the Target was particularly High Profile, gain **+1 Heat**.

---

## Crew Advancement
Much like individual Characters, the Crew as a whole can make advancements. As the Crew become better known, more opportunities will open up to them.

### Gaining Reputation
**Reputation** indicates how well known, respected, and feared the Crew are among their clients, allies, and enemies. 

**When Rep passes certain Thresholds, the Crew's Rank increases:**
|  # Rep |   Rank    | Tags                                            |
| -----: | :-------: | :---------------------------------------------- |
|  0 Rep |  Unknown  | ⛉⛉ Nobodies\*                                 |
| 10 Rep | Whispers  | Safehouse, ⛉ Unproven\*                        |
| 20 Rep |   Known   | ⛊ Proven, ⛊ Connections, Market Contacts      |
| 40 Rep | Respected | High Profile Jobs, ⛊ Better Pay, ⛊ Protection |
| 60 Rep | Connected | ⛊ Loyal Allies, ⛉ Observed                    |
| 80 Rep |  Legends  | ⛊ Legacy Status, ⛉ Mortal Enemies             |

**Tags marked with a \* are removed at the next Rank. Unmarked Tags carry over.**

Increasing your Rank brings with it access to **Advantages** (Safehouse, Market Contacts), and Tags (⛊, ⛉) that might add Action/Danger die to checks related to the Crew.

For shorter, faster campaigns, half the required number of ticks.

<br/>
**Reputation is gained at the end of a job, depending on a number of factors:**
- **Archetype:** Gain **+1** Rep if the group played to the particular strengths (Triggers) of Crew.
- **Noise:** Gain **+1** Rep if you gained 2 or more Heat during the job.
- **Profile:** Gain **+1** to **+3** Rep, depending on the Tier of the target. **0-1: +1** | **2-3: +2** | **4: +3.**
- **Bonus:** At the GMs discretion, the Crew may gain an additional **+1-2** Rep for longer jobs, or for especially successful jobs (Quiet, clean, bonus objectives, etc.)

---

## Upgrades
In addition to the benefits of Rank, you can commit time, money, and skill toward Upgrades; Features and Benefits that help the entire Crew.

**As a note:** The Upgrades you choose should make logical sense with the fiction. *For example: Regular Clientele requires you to be running some sort of side business.*

### Crew Features

**When your Reputation Rank increases, pick a new Feature:**

|      Upgrade      | Features                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### The Safehouse
Unlocked at Rank 2, the Crew have access to a shared Safehouse. This can be upgraded to expand its use.

Prior to this, the Crew can still have a place to meet and plan; a public place, an abandoned building, or a backroom in a building owned by a trusted contact.
The only implication is that they won't yet have the means or permission to start making improvements.

#### Property
Property comes with some inherent features. These don't count toward the Property's Max Improvements. *Re-style these as desired.*

Additionally, feel free to adjust the cost from -20% to +20%, based on the area/district the property is in. Or waive the cost entirely if the Crew earned it through a job, or from a contact.

**If for any reason you lose access to these Improvements (Moving Property, Destruction, Acts of God), you also lose the benefit you gained from it.**

When moving to a new Property, at the GM's discretion, carry over purchased improvements up to the Max of the new property.
**This doesn't include Features the original property inherently had, such as the Tenement's "Gang Territory", or the Dojo's "Training Room"**

## Contacts & Status

### Crew Contacts
Much like individual Characters, the crew have access to Contacts; a network of friends, fixers, and experts.

The Crew starts knowing **One Friend**. This is a shared contact. One PC might have more of a relationship with them than the others, but you all know them enough to trust them.

Give them a **name**, and an **occupation** (ideally one that makes them useful), and a **detail** about how you know them.


### Faction Relations
The Crew Sheet also tracks relations between the Crew and individual Factions.

Your **Faction Relations** are rated from **-3** to **+3**. This rating can add **Action Die** or **Danger Die** to checks with the associated Faction.

**At the start of play, pick either:**
- One faction to have +1 with, 
<br/>**OR**
- One faction to have +2 with, and another to have -1 with. 

**Consider what this means for the crew.** Maybe one is a group you've worked with before, and the other is group you've upset, or owe a favour to?

See [Factions](/rustpnk/docs/cfactions/) for a full list.
