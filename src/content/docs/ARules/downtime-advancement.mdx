## Aftermath Phase
Immediately after a Job is the Aftermath Phase. This is when rewards from Jobs are paid out, and **Hostility** & **Status** are tallied up.

See [Crew Mechanics](/rustpnk/docs/arules/crew-faction) for more detail about the stages of this phase.

---

### Hostility
**Hostility** represents how likely your enemies are to make a move against you.

**Hostility** is displayed as a Track, split into groups of three, every **three ticks** your Retribution Rating increases. 

As your Retribution increases, the events and complications you'll face during downtime become more severe.

#### Gaining Hostility
Hostility is gained at the end of a job, depending on a number of factors:
- **Noise:** If the job was loud and chaotic, gain **+1 Hostility**.
- **Evidence:** If the Crew were identified, or left behind a trail of evidence linking back to them, gain **+1 Hostility**.
- **Profile:** If the Target was particularly High Profile, gain **+1 Hostility**.

---

### Status
**Status** indicates how well known, respected, and feared the Crew are among their clients, allies, and enemies. 

**When Status passes certain Thresholds, the Crew's Status Rank increases:**
<div class="table-full">
| 0 Status | 10 Status | 20 Status | 40 Status | 60 Status | 80 Status |
| -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Unknown  | Whispers  | Known     | Connected | Respected | Legends   |
</div>

<br/>

#### Gaining Status
**Status is gained at the end of a job, depending on a number of factors:**
- **Archetype:** Gain **+1** Status if the group played to the particular strengths (Triggers) of Crew.
- **Noise:** Gain **+1** Status if you gained 2 or more Hostility during the job.
- **Profile:** Gain **+1** to **+3** Status, depending on the Tier of the target. **0-1: +1** | **2-3: +2** | **4: +3.**
- **Bonus:** At the GMs discretion, the Crew may gain an additional **+1-2** Status for longer jobs, or for especially successful jobs (Quiet, clean, bonus objectives, etc.)

---

### Payout ₩
At the end of a job, the team (as a collective) are paid an amount of ₩on determined by the nature, opposition, and expected challenges of the job.

**Opposition/Employer/Rank** - **Typical Payout**
- **Street Gang / Rank I:** ₩1,500 - ₩3,000
- **Organised Gang / Rank II:** ₩3,000 - ₩6,000
- **Major Syndicate / Rank III:** ₩6,000 - ₩12,000
- **Corporation / Rank IV:** ₩12,000 - ₩24,000
- **Mega-Corporation or Nation / Rank V+:** ₩24,000 - ₩50,000

Expect these payouts to be modified by some percentage depending on the client's requirements, additional objectives, relative success, and the cost of any gear provided to pull off the job.

Additional loot such as data and loose items can usually be sold to a fence for a marked-down fee. Player contacts or other special efforts to locate the *right* buyer can increase the amount gained.

---

## Downtime Phase
The period between Jobs is called Downtime. During this time, characters can train, attempt to [heal injuries](/rustpnk/docs/arules/combat-harm-healing#recovery), purchase [gear](/rustpnk/docs/arules/gear), work on projects, etc.

---

### Advancement
Characters learn and grow from their experiences. This is reflected through advancement.

#### Experience Points (EXP)
Experience represents growth and development. Characters mark Experience at the end of each job for each of the following that is true:
- **You Survived:** Even if the job was a failure, you made it out alive. **Gain +1 EXP**, *or at the GM's discretion, +2 if the job was particularly long or difficult.*

- **You Faced your Demons:** One or more of your **Flaws** caused you significant trouble during the job. **Gain +1 EXP.**
- **You Faced Adversity:** You suffered, but at least you learned from it. **Gain +1 EXP** for *each* **Botch** Result or **Trauma** you suffered.
- **You Made a Connection:** You made use of your **Ties** to another player character, or otherwise **developed your relationship** with them in some meaningful way. **Gain +1 EXP.**
- **You Chased a Dream:** You made progress toward your **Drive** in some specific, meaningful way. **Gain +1 EXP.**
<br/>
Clear **8 EXP** to do one of the following:
- Write a new **Trademark** (to a maximum of 4)
- Write a new **Edge** for any trademark (to a maximum of 5 per Trademark)
- Increase your **Physical** or **Mental** Hit Track by one (to a maximum of 5)
- Increase your **Stunt Point** maximum by one (to a maximum of 5)
- Increase your **Augmentation Slots** by one (to a maximum of 5)
<br/>
#### Change your Character
At the GM's discretion, you may also make the following changes during downtime:
- Change a trademark’s name
- Add a trigger to a trademark.
- Change / swap an edge
- Change a trauma description
- Change your drive.
- Add, Remove or Replace an Augmentation.
<br/>- Installing Augs takes a toll on your body. Make a check. If you fail, you'll suffer Augmentation Sickness that lasts the duration of the next job.
<br/>- There are drugs available to combat this, but don't expect them to be readily available.

Try to make changes and advancements relevant to your character's current or changing situation, and to the overall story at play.

### Spending ₩

#### Uses for ₩on
- **Training:** Spend ₩2,000 to mark an additional **+1 EXP**, once per-job.
- **Pay for Treatment:** Spend ₩2,000 to heal 1 **Physical Trauma**. The price doubles for each subsequent Trauma, to represent more complex care, but resets after each job.
- **Repair Gear:** Pay 25% of the base cost of the Item/Aug. The need for this depends on how reckless you are, but applies in cases where Trauma results in gear being lost or damaged.
- **Purchase/Upgrade Gear:** Players can purchase and upgrade their Augs and Equipment. 
<br/>- Depending on the rarity or legality of the item, characters may need to make special efforts to acquire it.
<br/>- Characters may be required to call upon contacts, factions, local knowledge, or their own skills to acquire or modify what they need.
<br/>- Items/Weapons/Armour have a maximum limit of 2 Advanced Tags (Upgrades). Augmentations do not have this limit.

---

### Long Term Projects
Players can pile money, skill, and time into Projects during Downtime, which will come to fruition at a later date. This can be done once per-job.

A long-term project could be any number of things, from working your way into a social circle, uncovering information, upgrading gear (adding additional tags), or repairing a damaged vehicle, etc.

#### Starting a Project
Agree with the GM how complex the project is to achieve. The GM will start a **4-12 segment clock** to represent your progress.

#### Making Progress
**Create a Dice Pool.** Add Action Die for **relevant edges and advantages** that would help you with your project. Add Danger Die for any **challenges** or **factors that might impede you**.

Each time you roll to make progress, decide with the GM how **expensive** progress will be. Access to materials, people, and specialist tools isn't cheap.
<br/>If you have all the skills and material at hand, it doesn't need to cost anything at all.

**Consult the following to see how it goes:**
- **On a 6:** Tick the Progress Clock twice, **OR** Tick the Progress Clock once, and reduce the cost by 50%.
- **On a 4-5:** Tick the Progress Clock once.
- **On a 1-3:** A Complication occurs and you make No Progress **OR** Tick the Progress Clock once, and pay an additional 50%.

- **On a Boon:** Add an additional tick to the clock, **OR** forego all monetary cost. If you have 2 or more boons, you can do both.
- **On a Botch:** A Complication occurs and you make No Progress

If the project costs money, pay what is owed now, **regardless** of if you **succeeded** or **failed**.
<br/>At the GM's discretion, you could add this cost to a **Debt**.


---

## Narrative Phase 
This is an opportunity to play out scenes from the character's everyday lives, meet with contacts, fish for opportunities, get caught in Events, and/or generally get into trouble.

**Narrative scenes don't have to take place in sequence**, they can take place all at the same time, or even as part of a flashback (i.e. in a character's past, before/an unseen part of the last job, etc.).

**Scenes played out during this phase share the same mechanics as the Job phase.** Checks are made when it seems like what the characters are doing has a chance of failure or complication.
*Often the consequences are lowered in this phase, but not always!*

Likewise, if it makes sense, and it seems as though the fiction is naturally flowing from the Narrative Phase to the Job Phase, establish **Loadout** and switch phase.

### Hostility / Retribution
As players begin to make waves in the city of Wuhai, people will begin to take notice. 

There is a chance that events and complications may occur to help or hinder the crew. 
<br/>These can occur whenever it makes narrative sense, and will be increasingly dangerous the more enemies and hostility the crew build up.

##### Optional "Retribution Roll"
To inject an element of chance, you can optionally use a "Retribution Roll" to decide if an complication should occur.

Create a pool of dice as usual. 

**Add Action Die for:**
- **Contacts:** If the crew have a contacts that can help them prepare for or weather the incoming threat, add **+1** Action Die.
- **Allied Factions:** For each **Faction at +2 or above**, add **+1** Action Die.
- **Security:** Take into account any tags the crew have from improvements, such as "Security" from their Safehouse. Add **+1** Action Die for each of these.

**Add Danger Die for:**
- **Retribution:** Every Three Hostility the Crew have increases their Retribution Rating. **Add Danger Die equal to their Retribution Rating.**
- **Enemy Factions:** For each **Faction at -2 or below**, add **+1** Danger Die.
- **(In-)Security:** For any tags relating to a lack of security that the crew may have, or any expensive assets they have which are poorly protected, add **+1** Danger Die.
