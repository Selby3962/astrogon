## Loadout
Every piece of gear takes up a certain number of "**Slots**", shown with one or more ◆.

Before a job begins, Characters pick a **Loadout** between Light (Max 3 ◆'s worth of items), and Heavy (Max 6 ◆'s worth of items).<br/>

<br/>Instead of choosing specific items before a job, instead, at any time, you can declare and produce any gear you own, up to the maximum of your Loadout.

Loadout indicates how geared-up an Character appears to observers. The heavier your loadout, the more obviously ready for action you are.

**If you pick up additional items during a job that would take you above your chosen Loadout:**
- If you are currently Light, you become Heavy.
- If you are currently Heavy, add +1 Danger Die for each slot above when rolling to do something where this extra weight would hinder you.

#### Additional Info
- Advanced Tags (e.g. Lightweight Materials) reduces how many Slots a piece of gear takes.
- Tags gained from Cyberware, (e.g. Microfibral Muscle's "Carry" tag), increase the amount you can carry in each tier by 1. (Light: Max 4 | Heavy: Max 7)

## Tags
Items and Augmentations have **"Tags"** associated with them.

These can be **positive** or **negative**, either Adding **Action Die** (⛊) or **Danger Die** (⛉), depending on the context of their use.

If a tag has no symbol (No ⛊ or ⛉), it doesn't add dice, but does **enable a particular action that otherwise may have been impossible**.




#### Additional Info
- **Tags are only applied when they become relevant.** For example, the Portable Lab's "⛊ Identify" tag only applies when its used to Identify something.
- Items and Augmentations also have **"Advanced Tags"**. These help to **expand the function and further individualise Gear**. These can be acquired by spending ₩, calling on contacts, or as rewards for jobs.
- Basic Gear, Weapons, and Armour have a **limit of 2 Advanced Tags at a time**. Augmentations **do not** have these limits.

## Augmentations
**Augs are expensive and costly to upgrade**, but enable you to **surpass human limits**. In addition, they **don't count toward your weight limit on a job**. You can think of them like "Stunts" or "Feats"from other systems.

Augmentation places strain upon the body. **Each Character starts with 3 Aug Slots, and each Aug takes up 1 Slot.**
- Your maximum Augmentation Slots can be increased with [Advancements](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).

You can purchase, install and swap out Augmentations during [Downtime](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).

#### Augmentation Sickness
- When Installing or Swapping out an Augmentation. Make a check. Add Action/Danger die for anything that would help/hinder the procedure or the aftercare.
- On a 1-3, you gain the "Augmentation Sickness" condition, which lasts until the end of the next job.
- Calcineurin Inhibitors cure Aug Sickness sooner, but don't come cheap.
