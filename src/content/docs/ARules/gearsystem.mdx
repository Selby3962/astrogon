## Gear
Gear covers all of a character's belongings, from Weapons and Armour, to Drugs, to Augmentations and Vehicles.

### Features
Gear and Augmentations have Features. Details that define what actions they allow, and any specific advantages and disadvantages they may have.
- **Some actions are Enabled by gear.**<br/>Meaning, the use of this gear allows you to do something you previously couldn't. <br/>There is no <AD/>/<TD/> added for these.
- **Some gear have Advantages**<br/>Advantages might add Advantage Dice <AD/> to relevant checks, or provide some other benefit.
- **Likewise, some gear may have Disadvantages**.<br/>Disadvantages might reduce a Skill, add Threat Dice <TD/> to relevant checks, or be purely fictional problems, (E.g. Slow, Noisy, etc.).
- **Some pieces of gear have limited uses.**<br/>This could be a limited duration (E.g. up to an hour), limited uses per-job (recovered during Downtime), or are consumed on use (E.g. Grenades, Drugs).
- **Features and Advantages are only applied when they become relevant.** <br/>For example, the Survival Kit's +1<AD/> to Survival checks only applies when attempting something specific to the kit.
- **Items and Augmentations can also be upgraded with Mods**.<br/>Mods can add features, remove disadvantages, and further individualise Gear.<br/> Mods can be acquired with ₩on, crafting, and contacts.
    - Basic Gear, Weapons, Armour, and Vehicles have a limit of two mods at a time (without access to a [Workshop](/rustpnk/arules/crew-faction)). Augmentations do not have these limits.

### Loadout
There is no hard limit on the amount of gear a person can *own* at any time, other than the ₩on required to purchase it.

There is, however, a limit on how much Gear a character can bring with them on a Job, represented as "Loadout".
Every piece of gear takes up a certain number of **Gear Slots**, shown with one or more ◆.

**Before a job begins:**
- Characters choose a **Loadout** between **Subtle** (Max 3 ◆'s worth of items), and **Obvious** (Max 6 ◆'s worth of items).<br/>
- They must also declare any **Heavy** items, (Items weighing ◆◆◆ or more).<br/> If you are carrying a Heavy item, your Loadout is automatically treat as Obvious.
- Additionally, if you are using any Vehicles for the job. Declare them now.<br/> You can choose one vehicle per-character able to drive it.

Loadout indicates how geared-up an Character appears to observers. The more you carry, the more obviously kitted out and ready for action you are.


<br/>
<p class="text-center">**Instead of choosing specific items before a job, instead, at any time, you can declare and produce any gear you own, up to the maximum of your Loadout.**</p>
<br/>


#### Additional Info
**Reducing Gear Slots / Increasing Loadout Limits:**
- Mods (e.g. Lightweight Materials) reduce how many Slots a piece of gear takes.
- Augmentations can adjust your Loadout Limits (e.g. Microfibral Muscle).

**Vehicles:**
- Vehicles have Gear Slots as well, allowing you to draw gear up to this total from them during a job.<br/> - This can be useful to access a heavy item you didn't declare, or to switch from Subtle to Obvious mid-job.<br/> - **For example:** You can case the joint while Subtle, then return and gear up to Obvious for the heist.
- Vehicles are expensive. If you only need it for one job, consider *renting* it instead.<br/> - Rent costs are significantly cheaper than buying one outright.<br/> - See [Gear](/rustpnk/docs/etables/gear) for a full list of prices.

**Going above your chosen Loadout:**
- If you go above **Subtle** (> 3 ◆), you **become Obvious**.
- If you go above **Obvious**(> 6 ◆), **add +1 Threat Die for each slot above your Maximum** to any checks where extra weight or bulkiness might hinder you.

### Security
While there are no hard limits on the number of items a character can own, there may be fictional disadvantages to owning more than you can securely store.

There aren't specific mechanics to track this, but apply common sense. 

**For Example:**
- A character purchases a flashy new supercar, but keeps it outside in a slum with no secure parking. <br/>Don't expect your wheels to still be there in the morning.

---

## Augmentations
**Augs are expensive, but enable you to surpass ordinary human limits.**<br/> You can think of them like "Stunts" or "Feats" from other systems.

**Characters start with 3 Aug Slots, and each Aug takes up 1 Slot.**<br/> Each Augmentation places strain upon the body.<br/> This can be increased later using [Advancements](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).

<br/>
### Installing & Modding Augmentations
**You can purchase, install and swap out Augs during [Downtime](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).**

**You cannot install new Augmentations, or modify existing ones without surgery and the help of a specialist.**<br/> 
- This could be an Unlicensed Chopdoc, a Licensed AUG Clinician, or another Player Character.


#### Augmentation Rejection
**When Installing or Swapping out Augmentations:**
- Make a Check, start with 3<TD/> as a base.<br/> Add <AD/>/<TD/> for anything that would Help/Hinder the procedure or the aftercare.
- **On a Major or Minor Success:** The procedure goes well, and your body adapts quickly.
- **On a Hollow or Bane:** The procedure goes poorly, and your immune system flares in response to the new Augmentation. Gain the "Augmentation Rejection" condition for the duration of the next job.
- **Calcineurin Inhibitors cure Aug Rejection sooner, but don't come cheap.**

## Mods
**Items and Augmentations can be upgraded with Mods**
- Mods can add features, remove disadvantages, and further individualise Gear.
- Mods can be acquired with ₩on, crafting, and contacts.
- Basic Gear, Weapons, Armour, and Vehicles have a limit of two Mods at a time (without access to a [Workshop](/rustpnk/arules/crew-faction)). Augmentations do not have these limits.

<br/>
### Installing Mods
**Installing a Mod is easy enough.**
- Once you have purchased or crafted a mod, you can freely swap it out at any point during Downtime.
- Augmentation Mods require specialist surgery and aftercare. See **Installing and Modifying Augmentations** above.

## Crafting
Crafting Gear and Mods takes time, skill, and money.

Treat it as a [Project](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement), and make Checks (likely using Engineering or Tech) to progress it during Downtime.
