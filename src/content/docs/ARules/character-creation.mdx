## Write Three "Aspects"

Who were you before, who are you now, how have you survived?

- Aspects are descriptors that define **the most iconic details** of your character's life and skills.
- Your Aspects are a combination of a **Background**, an **Archetype**, and a **Trait**.

<p class="text-center">The following table contains example Aspects, along with suggested skills and flaws.<br/>**Pick Three Aspects, one from each category.**</p>
<p class="text-center">**An Aspect can be almost anything. It's encouraged to mix and match, re-name, re-style, and work with the GM to create something that fits your vision**</p>

## Assign Six Points to Skills
Skills represent broad areas of knowledge. 
- Your choice of Skills should be relevant to your Aspects.
- Skills are rated from 0 - 4. They cannot go above +3 at Character Creation.
- When making a [Check](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks), you roll Advantage Dice (AD <AD/>) equal to your Skill.

<br/>
<p class="text-center">**Assign 6 Points, spread between the Skills below:**

## Write Three Expertise
Expertise represent narrow, specialist areas of knowledge.
- Like Skills, Expertise should be relevant to your Aspects.
- Each Expertise should be unique. You cannot pick the same Expertise twice.
- Each Skill can have at most 3 Expertise. These can be swapped out during [Downtime](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement).
- When making a [Check](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks), each relevant Expertise grants +1 Advantage Die <AD/>.
- You can use multiple Expertise in a single Check, as long as they're attached to the same Skill being used.<br/>
    - *If you have a relevant Expertise attached to a different Skill, you can make a case for how you apply it in a different context.<br/>The GM has final say about whether or not it is appropriate.*

<p class="text-center">**Pick Three Expertise from the table above, or make up your own.**<br/>**Write them in the space next to relevant skills.**</p>

<br/>

## Write Three "Flaws"

Flaws are details that can be invoked (either by yourself, or the GM) to hinder you.
- When a Flaw is invoked during a [Check](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks), you add 1 Threat Die <TD/>, making the check more difficult.
- When a Flaw impedes you in this way, you restore a single [Action Point](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks#action-points). <br/>
*Action Points can be spent to avoid harm and take control of the action.*


<p class="text-center">**Pick or create Three Flaws, one for each Aspect.**</p>

## Pick Starting Gear
**Characters start with an amount of gear and augmentations to represent belongings and advantages acquired in their lives up to this point.**

#### Basic Information
##### Loadout
- **Gear Slots** represented with: (◆) indicate how bulky an item is.
- Characters pick a Loadout between Light (3 ◆'s worth of items), and Heavy (6 ◆'s worth of items) before a job begins. **You don't need to worry about this now.**
- A character's loadout implies how geared-up an Character appears to observers. The heavier your loadout, the more obviously ready for action you are.

##### Tags
- Items and Augmentations have **"Tags"** associated with them.
- These can be **positive** or **negative**, either Adding **Action Die** (⛊) or **Danger Die** (⛉).
- If a tag has no symbol (⛊/⛉), it doesn't add dice, but does **enable a particular action that otherwise may have been impossible**.
- **Tags are only applied when they become relevant.** For example, the Portable Lab's "⛊ Identify" tag only applies when its used to Identify something.
- Items and Augmentations also have **"Advanced Tags"**. These help to **expand the function and further individualise Gear**. These **aren't available during Character Creation**, and must be acquired through play.

For more information, see: [Gear System](/rustpnk/docs/arules/gear)

---
### Tools of the Trade

**First, pick one of the following configurations:**
- **A.** An Item related to Trademarks + a mix of 3 Drugs/Grenades
- **B.** A Vehicle related to Trademarks.
<br/>
**As well as one of the following:**
- **A.** A Melee Weapon or Light Sidearm & Security-Grade Armour
- **B.** A Heavy Sidearm, Rifle, or Shotgun.

<br/>
**Choose from the lists below, or work with the GM to create something more bespoke.**

- **Augs are expensive and costly to upgrade**, but enable you to **surpass ordinary human limits**, and **don't count toward your weight limit on a job**. You can think of them like "Stunts" or "Feats"from other systems.
- Augmentation places strain upon the body. **Each Character starts with 3 Aug Slots, and each Aug takes up 1 Slot.** You can't go beyond this limit right now, so you don't need to consider it when making a choice.
- Some Augmentations are rarer than others. **During character creation, you can only choose from the Common and Uncommon Augs**, indicated in the tables below.
- You can purchase, install and swap out Augs during [Downtime](/rustpnk/docs/arules/downtime-advancement). **Your choices now don't have to be permanent, just go with what seems cool.**
<br/>
**Choose some starting Augmentations. Pick one of the following configurations:**
- **A.** Two Common Augs
- **B.** One Uncommon Aug
<br/>
**Choose from the lists below, or work with the GM to create something more bespoke. Hover over dotted names for more detail.**

#### Heavily Augmented Characters
For characters who's background involves having a lot of Augmentations, discuss with the GM how to reconcile this discrepancy with the limited starting budget. *For example:*

- A former-corp agent may have been provided with expensive Augs, but they have since been remotely shut down by the company.
- A thug, wired up with chop-shop Augs would likely struggle with the ongoing maintenance required, leaving them to rust and fall into disrepair.
- Work with the GM to invent a particular, *signature Aug* as a "Trademark", its tags are the *"Edges"* you add to it. An Aug added this way does not count toward your Augmentation Limit.

#### Un-Augmented Characters
For characters who prefer to remain pure and untainted by Augmentation, ask the GM about upgrading two of your Items, Vehicles, or Weapons/Armour with **Advanced Tags**. Keeping up with the augmented competition wasn't easy.

## Form Connections

### Player Connections

**Pick another player**, and work together to **add a detail** about how you know each other.

A previous job? An ex-lover? **Make something up, pick, or roll 1d20** on the table below.

Add an **Edge** to one of your Trademarks, gained or honed in some way by that connection.

You can have as many narrative connections to other players as you want, but **you only gain an Edge for one of them**.

#### Connection
|     |                                                                   |     |                                                 |

|  10 | Worked for the same crew, the rest are dead, but you two survived |  20 | You pulled a lot of all-nighters together       |


### NPC Connections
You start play knowing either **two Acquaintances** *or* **one Friend**.

Give them a **name**, and an **occupation** (ideally one that makes them useful), and a **detail** about how you know them.

You also have a **Rival**, someone you may have wronged who hates your guts.

Give them a **name**, an **occupation**, and a **detail** about why they hate you.

This could be a person related to your Debt, or someone entirely different.

**If you can't think of anything now, leave this, and invent them at a convenient moment during play.**

## Flesh Out your Character

<Notice type="note"> Discuss these, if you have a cool idea already, great! Write it down! <br/><br/> If not, no worries, there's no need to solidify these details now. All of the following can be decided during play. Declare contacts, background, etc. when the situation calls for it.</Notice>

### Pick a "Drive"

Determine a **Drive or Motivation** for your character. *What makes them continue to live this dangerous life?*

This could be a personal **aspiration**, a pressing **obligation**, or an **impending threat**.

If you are stuck, ask other players for ideas, or roll **1d20** on the following table and add your own **details** to flesh it out, and make it more specific.
#### Drive
|     |                                                                |     |                                                          |

|  10 | You have a personal vendetta against a particular corp or gang |  20 | You want to pursue justice for yourself, or someone else |
<br/>
<Notice type="note">If you are stuck for ideas, you can use [this list](https://onestopforwriters.com/character_motivations) for inspiration.</Notice>

This can (and likely will) change over time, or once you start playing and your character's situation changes, which is fine. **It's main function is to let the GM know your Character's ambitions so they can work it into scenarios.**

**If you can't decide right now, no worries!** One will probably develop during play, when it does, talk about it, then write it down.

### How did you get here?

**How did you end up in Wuhai?** Come up with a *general idea* for how and why your Character is in Wuhai.

Play to your **Contacts**, **Connection**, and **Drive**. And your **Trademarks**, are likely related in some way.

Are they a Wuhai local? Are they a Migrant from another nation? Are they a nomad from the Expanse? Have they been here long?

These details help establish your character's implied knowledge and insight about Wuhai and beyond, and the kind of groups they may have ran into before.

This is great information to know, but **if you can't think of anything right now**, or want to experience the setting first, **leave it blank and decide during play**.

### Pick Languages

Wuhai is a hugely, culturally diverse place, so knowing at least a few languages is pretty standard. Not to mention the commonplace auto-translation augs available.

**Most people speak English and Mandarin as common languages.** There are also many Russian, Korean, Japanese, and Spanish speakers here.

Feel free to **pick an additional language** based on your **heritage** or **background** if it makes sense to do so.
