## Harm & Healing

---

### Hit Tracks
Characters have **Two Hit Tracks**:
- **Physical:** Representing *toughness, health, and endurance*.
- **Mental:** Representing *mental health, willpower, and determination*.

When a character **suffers harm**, you will mark one of these boxes, depending on what kind of harm you suffered.<br/>

How often you make use of the "Mental" track depends on the tone you desire for the game.
Ticking this track is a good way to apply additional, slower pressure upon characters, without needing to resort to physical harm.
- If you want your PCs driven mad by the horrors they witness day to day and battle with emotional and internal threats as much as external, lean into it more.
- If you're more interested in pulp action, and characters with unshakeable will, use it less, or ignore it entirely.

---

### Trauma
Traumas are tags that represent serious injuries or ongoing physical, emotional or psychological harm. <br/>

A character that must mark one or more hits, but **has no empty boxes** immediately **writes a Trauma**.
The type of Trauma you suffer depends on what kind of harm caused it, **Physical** or **Mental**.

Upon writing a new **Physical Trauma**, there is a chance you are also **Dying**. See Below.

While **Traumas apply Danger Dice to all checks**, they’re also roleplaying cues and should influence how you portray a character.

There are as many different traumas as there are ways to be harmed, but here are a few examples:
- **BROKEN/CRUSHED:** Arm, leg, fingers, toes, ribs, jaw, heart, spirit
- **WOUNDED/PUNCTURED:** Gut, chest, eye, face, limb, hand, pride
- **LOST:** Fingers, toes, limb, cyberware, connection, self control
- **BRUISED:** Spine, throat, chest, organs, ego
- **RUINED:** Ear, nervous system, cyberware, reputation, self esteem
- **WEAKENED:** heart, immune system, resolve, spirit
- **BLACKOUT:** You lose your sight/hearing
- **DIGITAL GHOSTS:** You are accosted by hallucinations and after-images.
- **FIREWALLED:** You cannot interface and your cyberware is compromised.
- **HIJACKED:** Every action is a fight for control of your own mind/body.
- **JITTERS:** Uncontrollable shakes and/or reduced dexterity.
- **NERVE BURN:** Your nerve endings feel like they are on fire.
<br/>

### Dying
When your character has suffered severe harm, there's a good chance they'll die.
- When you write a new **Physical Trauma** roll a **D6**; **on a “1” the character is also dying.**.
- Upon marking a **4th Trauma**, there is no roll, your character is **dying**.

**A dying character will die in D6 turns.**

Anyone can stabilize a dying character by making a **check** with **Danger Die** for every **Trauma** the character currently has:
- **6:** The character is stabilized and can return to action, but their hit track remains completely filled. Boons can clear hit boxes, one for one.
- **4 OR 5:** The character is stabilized but remains unconscious until they recover at least one hit box (see Recovery).
- **3 OR LESS:** The character is not stabilized and continues to die.
- **BOTCH:** The character dies immediately.
<br/>

### Conditions
Conditions are temporary physical, emotional or psychological consequences. **Conditions add Danger Dice** if they're relevant to the check being made. <br/>
The duration of a Condition varies from a single turn, to multiple scenes, depending on its severity.

A Condition can be one of the following Severities:
- **Fleeting,** a round or two of combat.
- **Troubling,** a scene or two.
- **Enduring,** potentially the rest of the job.

<br/>
Conditions can be any number of things, but some examples include:
- **ANGRY:** You are filled with rage, which clouds your judgment and may cause you to act without thinking things through.
- **DAZED:** You are distracted, concussed or confused which slows your reactions and makes it difficult to concentrate or focus.
- **SCARED:** You are intensely afraid of someone, something or the environment in general. Taking action against the cause of the fear is particularly difficult.
- **RESTRAINED:** You are trapped, tangled, slowed or stuck in some manner and have difficulty moving or performing actions that require finesse.
- **WEAKENED:** You are physically impaired, lacking strength, energy or fortitude. Resisting physical hardship is particularly difficult.
<br/>

In addition, some conditions could cause you harm over time if not dealt with, such as **Poisoned**, **Burning**, or **Bleeding**:
- **POISONED:** You have toxins flowing through you. If you don't purge them, or remove the source of the toxins, you'll suffer.
- **BURNING:** You're burning up. If you don't extinguish yourself you'll die. Additionally, you're a hazard to everyone around you.
- **BLEEDING:** Losing blood fast. Staunch the flow or you'll die. The worse it gets, the weaker you'll become.
- **ELECTROCUTED / SHORT CIRCUIT:** Your limbs are seizing, and your Augs may not work as intended.

Don't forget, **Conditions can apply to enemies** as well. Take advantage of them to **even the odds** against particularly tough opponents.
<br/>
Many Conditions typically resolve themselves over time, but you may be able to end them sooner by taking action:
- If you're **Burning**, you might drop and roll to extinguish yourself.
- If you're **Bleeding**, you might be able to use an Electrocauter, or otherwise staunch the flow.

Consider this when dealing with **Troubling** conditions, especially during combat. Remember NPCs can do this too.

### Recovery

During a job, options for recovery are limited:
##### Drugs and Augmentations
- A character can use Drugs or Augmentations to restore hits. These are generally expensive and limited.

##### Rest
Once per job, during an extended period of rest, characters can perform both of the following:
- Support another character in some way. The other character can restore up to **3 Mental Harm** for free.
- Perform **First Aid**. Roll a Check, add any relevant modifiers, and also **add 1 Danger Die for each trauma**. Success/Partial heals 1 hit. Boons clear additional hits, one for one.

At the GM's discretion, when it makes sense, characters may rest more than once per job. This is particularly relevant for longer jobs.

#### Trauma
Typically, Traumas cannot be removed mid-job.
However, during [Downtime](/docs/arules/downtime-advancement) you can do the following:
- Make a Check. If you have any skills, or access to anything (or anyone) that might help you recover more easily, add any relevant Action Dice to the roll. Add one Danger Die for every additional Trauma you have, or poor conditions.
<br/>- A result of 6 removes the trauma.
<br/>- This can be done once per-trauma, once per-downtime.
- Take your character out of play for at least one job, depending on the severity of your injuries. During this time, play a different character.
<br/>- Recovery this way implies a lengthy period of rest, which is time for events to progress, opportunities to slip away, and enemies to make moves without your opposition.
- Pay for specialist help. This is a costly option. See [Spending ₩](/docs/arules/downtime-advancement#earning--spending).

## Combat

### Momentum
Whichever side currently has "**Momentum**" gets to control the action. 

**At the start of Combat:**
- Decide a Turn Order for Players. (E.g. Flip a coin, heads is Clockwise, tails is Counter-Clockwise).
- Roll 1d6.
    - **On a 1-3:** The enemies start with Momentum and will act first.
    - **On a 4-6:** The characters will start with Momentum, and will act first.
    - **SURPRISE:** If one side gets the drop on the other, they immediately take a turn. Roll for initiative **after** they complete their surprise actions.

<br/>
Whoever has **Momentum** gets to act, and Momentum **swaps back and forth with the flow of Successes and Failures**.

**The Players roll every check**, either making an active move against the enemy, or reacting to a move made against them. 

- **On a Success:** Momentum remains with or shifts to the players. The next player in the turn order gets to declare an action.
- **On a Partial Success:** As a partial consequence or benefit, Momentum *could* shift either way.
- **On a Fail:** Momentum remains with or shifts to the enemies. 

If you find yourself caught in a spiral of failures, the currently acting player can **spend a Stunt Point to Seize Momentum for the players**. See [Stunt Points](docs/arules/skill-checks#stunt-points).

The player who spent the Stunt Point gets to act first. After they act (assuming they Succeed), move on to the next player in the original Turn Order.

### Attacking
When **attacking an enemy**, describe what you do and **make a check**.

A **Success** or **Partial Success** causes Harm to the target based on the type of weapon used (See [Gear](/docs/arules/gear)). **Boons** can be spent to cause **additional hits**.

If the intent is to knock down, stun, trap or inflict some other **Condition**, describe how you do it and make the check. **Certain weapon types have a chance of inflicting Conditions** as part of their **Feature**.

**Partial Successes, Failed attacks and Botches can result in consequences** such as suffering harm back, guns jamming, being knocked down, dazed or trapped, losing a weapon or running out of ammo.
<br/>

#### Unaware Targets
When attacking an unaware target, add Action and Danger die related to remaining hidden, along with any die for the attack.
- **On a Boon:** Deal twice as many hits.
- **On a Success:** The target also gains a condition (in addition to any conditions already granted by the weapon.)

---
### Defending
When **targeted by an attack**, describe how you are avoiding or resisting harm and **make a check**.

Different **Trademarks, Edges** and **Tags** will be relevant depending on the approach you choose:
- When **dodging, ducking, weaving and making yourself harder to hit**, tags that increase your **mobility** are going to be useful.
- If attempting to **resist, endure, block or deflect an attack**, tags related to **armor**, **toughness** and **durability** are going to come into play.

What happens depends on the result of the check:
- **Success** means you don’t take a hit. 
- **Partial Success** you take reduced harm, or no harm at all, or might suffer some other consequence instead, such as a condition.
- **Failure** means you take the full hit, and possibly another consequence, such as a condition as well.
- **A Botch** results in the character suffering increased damage, or another appropriate consequence.

#### Armour
Wearing Armour grants you two main benefits:
- **Tags** that grant additional **Action Dice** when making **defense checks**. 
<br/>- For example, Security-Grade Armour provides the "Armoured" tag.
- Increases the maximum value of your **Armour Track**. Marking boxes on your Armour track allows you to **soak hits**, one for one. 
<br/>- For example, Security-Grade Armour sets your Armour Track to 2.
<br/>- This represents lucky hits, glancing blows, and taking hits in less lethal areas.

Once your Armour Track fills, the Armour **isn't broken**, it no longer soaks hits, but it still provides Action Die when defending against attacks, and any fictional advantages or disadvantages it may have.

<br/>

### NPC Stats

#### Hits
Unlike Player Characters (PCs), **NPCs only have one Hit Track, labelled "Harm"**, which tracks all sources of damage.

**Once it fills, the NPC will either die, pass out, give up, or attempt to flee.**

#### Toughness
NPCs have an associated **Toughness**, relative to their strength.

When facing off against an NPC, each point of **Toughness** adds one **Danger Die** to the pool. This is in addition to any conditions, gear, augs, scene tags etc. that might also add Danger Dice. (See: [Skill Checks](/docs/arules/skill-checks))

NPC Hit Tracks are split up into groups of 2. **Reduce Toughness by 1 each time a hit brings them below one of these Thresholds.**

An enemy that starts off almost untouchable, will gradually be weakened as the fight goes on.

#### Armour
NPC Armour functions differently to PC Armour. 
- NPCs can be Armoured, this is factored into their Toughness Rating.
- NPCs cannot use Armour to soak hits.

#### Trauma
Extremely tough, or reoccurring enemies may also have **Trauma** boxes, the same as PCs.
Typically, upon marking a Trauma, and not dying, the enemy will make an attempt to escape.
