## Getting Hurt
Instead of a pool of Hit Points, Player Characters (PCs) suffer **Conditions, Wounds, and Traumas**.

### Conditions
<p class="text-center">**Conditions are temporary afflictions.**<br/> Physical, Situational, or Psychological problems that cause trouble in the short-term.
<br/>When a Condition is relevant to a check being made, it adds +1 Threat Dice <TD/> to the pool.
<br/>There is no limit to the number of Conditions you can have a time.</p>
<br/>

- Conditions typically go away on their own after some time, or can be treated with simple actions.<br/> - **For Example:** Moving away from the source of the problem, applying pressure to a wound, etc.
- If not dealt with, a Condition could be compounded upon to become a Level 1 Wound.<br/> - **For Example:** Bleeding -> Minor Bloodloss, or Drained -> Tired.
- In the right context, a condition could also be a positive, adding Advantage Dice <AD/> to checks.<br/> - **For Example:** Drunk/High and resisting pain.

<br/>
**Example Conditions:**
| Condition   | Example Effect                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bleeding    | You're visibly bloodied, <TD/> to Influence.<br/> Likely to become a Level 1 Wound if not dealt with.                     |
| Burning     | Doing most things while ignited is going to be difficult, <TD/>.<br/> Likely to become a Level 1 Wound if not dealt with. |
| Drugged     | Whatever you took, it's kicking in. <TD/> if the effect of the drug would hinder your action.                             |
| Drunk       | You're stumbling around, <TD/> to Mobility, Dodging.<br/> Your nerves are numbed, <AD/> to Resisting Pain                 |
| Panicking   | You can't even think straight, let alone shoot. <TD/> to Shooting, Thinking.                                              |
| Pinned Down | Under suppressive fire. <TD/> when trying to move or aim from your current location.<br/>                                 |
| Stunned     | Reeling from a strong blow. <TD/> to Awareness, Shooting, Dodge.                                                          |

<p class="text-center">The Conditions and Effects in the table above are purely examples. <br/>Follow the fiction and only apply <AD/>/<TD/> when it makes sense.</p>

---

### Wounds
<p class="text-center">**Wounds are specific, longer-lasting Injuries**
<br/>Wounds can be Minor (Level One), or Severe (Level Two).
<br/>Once per Scene, per Wound, the GM can invoke the Wound to add +1 <TD/> per level of the Wound.<br/>The Wound must be relevant/hindering to the Check being made.</p>


#### Minor Wounds (Level One)
<br/><p class="text-center"> **Minor Wounds are the logical step up from Conditions.**</p><br/>

- Minor Wounds are removed when Recovering during Downtime.
- During a Job, in a moment of brief respite, Minor Wounds can be treat with First-Aid and/or the right gear.
- There are no hard-limits to Minor Wounds, however, if you ever take the same, or similar one twice, it becomes a Severe (Level Two) Wound.

<br/>
<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Minor Wounds:**
| Wound                    |                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Black Eye                | Dislocated [Finger/Shoulder] |
| Bullet Graze             | Sprained [Joint]             |
| Concussion               | Fractured [Bone]             |
| Minor [Burns/Poisoning]  | Torn Muscle                  |
| Shallow [Cut/Stab Wound] | Cracked [Bone]               |
</div>

<br/>
#### Severe Wounds (Level Two)
<br/><p class="text-center"> **Severe Wounds are serious injuries, on track to becoming life-threatening.**</p><br/>

- Severe Wounds require medical attention during Downtime. Recovery in this way turns them into Minor Wounds.
- During a Job, in a moment of brief respite, Severe Wounds might be treatable with First-Aid and the right gear, either reducing or removing them.
- **Unlike Conditions and Minor Wounds, you can only have at most 3 different Level Two Wounds.**<br/> - This limit can be increased by Augmentation. <br/> - If ever you need to write a Severe Wound, but all your boxes are full, immediately write a Trauma instead.

<br/>
<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Severe Wounds:**
| Wound                        |                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Broken [Limb]                | Shattered [Joint/Bone] |
| Bullet Wound                 | Internal Bleeding      |
| Fractured Skull              | Organ Damage           |
| Severe [Bloodloss/Poisoning] | Deep [Cut/Stab Wound]  |
</div>

---

### Trauma
<p class="text-center">**Traumas are desperate, life-threatening injuries.**<br/> Traumas **always** add +2 <TD/> to checks.</p>

<br/>
- Traumas require serious medical attention during Downtime. Recovery this way turns them into Severe Wounds.
- During a job, Traumas can only be temporarily mitigated at best, enabled by specialist medical gear and augmentations.
- **You can have at most 2 different Traumas at a time.**<br/> - Upon filling your last Trauma box, you are **Lost**.<br/> - This limit can be increased by Augmentation.

<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Trauma:**
| Wound              |                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Severed [Limb]     | Punctured [Vital Organ] |
| Massive Blood Loss | Organ Failure           |
| Brain Haemorrhage  | Paralysis               |
| 4th Degree Burns   | Crushed Chest           |
</div>

<br/>
#### Incapacitation
<p class="text-center">**When writing a new Trauma, you must immediately make the following Check to avoid being incapacitated.**</p>

- Add <AD/> for Toughness, or any other skill with expertise that provides resistance to pain and trauma.
- Add 1 <TD/> as a base.
- Add 1 <TD/> for each current Trauma and Condition.
- Add 1 <TD/> if you are currently within a dangerous environment that is actively harming you (toxins, fire, etc.)

<p/>
- **On a Major or Minor Success:** You persist and stay standing.
- **On a Hollow Success or Bane:** You succumb and fall to the floor, incapacitated.

While incapacitated, you require assistance from an ally soon, or else you will become **Lost**.<br/>
Use common sense to judge how long "soon" is. At most its the end of the scene, or a little longer than that.
<br/>

---

### Becoming Lost
<p class="text-center">**Signal Terminated**<br/>This dangerous life finally caught up to you.</p>



**Becoming "Lost" could mean a number of things:**
- **If it makes sense, and the player and GM agree, you die.** <br/> - Either immediately, or very soon. <br/> - You might get a check to do something heroic, and a last breath to say something dramatic.
- **You fall into a Coma.** <br/> - You aren't *dead*, but you ain't coming back any time soon, and not without life-changing issues.
- **Physically/Mentally Devastated** <br/> - By some cruel twist of fate, you're alive, but is that truly the better outcome?
- **M.I.A.** <br/> - Your crew lost sight of you in the chaos. You might not be dead, but you never made it back.

<br/>
<p class="text-center">**At an appropriate moment, either immediately, or at the end of the session, the Player or the GM narrate a brief vignette, depicting (or alluding to..) the fate of the character.**</p>
<br/>

---

### And yet you persist..
<p class="text-center">**A character who is lost doesn't have to be gone for good.** <br/>The GM and the Player discuss options and come to a satisfactory compromise.</p>

**If it makes sense, the character may be able to return in some form:**
- **As an NPC, likely much later on, potentially as a shell of their former selves.**<br/> - The GM takes control of your character, but you might be allowed to speak for them in specific scenarios.
- **As a PC, but only after significant time and recovery, and with a permanent debuff.** <br/> - You won't be able to play as them while they recover. You might be able to do brief vignettes involving them during Downtime, if their whereabouts are known, but they're fully out of action otherwise.
<br/> **When they return, you have a new, and highly intrusive Flaw:** <br/> - Phantom Pains from a missing limb, visible and obvious burns/scarring, a personality disorder, panic attacks, etc. 
<br/> **You have one fewer Trauma boxes.**
<br/> - No amount of recovery will get you back to your former strength.
<br/> **Your luck is used up.**
<br/> - The next time you become lost, it's **[Game Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_j8W-SDefU)**.

## Combat
Combat plays out largely the same as regular gameplay, with the exception of **Momentum**.

### Momentum
While engaged in hostilities with an NPC, Momentum determines when the Players are **Acting** or **Reacting**.

- While the **Players have Momentum**, any Player can take an action, often involving a Check.
- While the **Enemies have Momentum**, any Enemy can take an action, often to force Players to React with a Check.

Momentum passes back and forth with the flow of Successes and Failures.

---

#### Gaining/Maintaining/Losing Momentum
<p class="text-center">**A possible Consequence of a Check could be losing Momentum.**<br/>The enemy takes advantage of an opening, a mistake, or some other opportunity to strike back.</p>

**Examples:**
- **Gaining Momentum:** An NPC attacks a PC. The PC rolls to dodge and roll a Minor Success.<br/> They suffer a condition, but use their partial success to take back Momentum, shifting control back to the Players.
- **Losing Momentum:** A PC attacks an NPC, they roll a Minor Success. <br/>They deal damage, but as a consequence, the Enemy gets a chance to Act. The PC must now React or suffer.
- **Maintaining Momentum:** A PC Attacks an NPC, they roll a Minor Success. <br/> They deal less damage, but maintain Momentum. Another Player gets a chance to Act.

<p class="text-center">It is up to the GM to decide when the outcome of a roll shifts Momentum.<br/> Follow the fiction, and treat it as an [Advantage/Consequence](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks#advantages--consequences) like any other check.</p>

<br/>
#### Seize Momentum
If the Players find themselves caught in a spiral of failures, any player can spend an [Action Point](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks) to **Seize Momentum**.
- The Player who spent the point describes what they do to disrupt the flow, and create a momentary distraction, or opportunity.
- Momentum shifts back to the Players. <br/> - The player who spends the point decides who gets to Act.<br/> - Losing Momentum is unavailable as a Consequence for this first check.

---

#### Acting
**Acting is any active action taken by a Player Character. Some examples include:**
| Action           | Example Resolution                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attack           | Roll a Check. Success could mean dealing conditions and wounds of increasing effectiveness.                                                  |
| Disarm           | Roll A Check. Major Success knocks the Enemy's weapon from their hands. Minor or Hollow might put you and/or the target in a worse position. |
| Reposition       | Spend time getting into a more advantageous position, adding <AD/> to later checks.                                                          |
| Talk             | Roll a Check. Attempt diplomacy or intimidation, possibly inflicting a condition.                                                            |
| Use Gear/Aug     | Use a feature of gear or an augmentation. Throw a Grenade, Use Meds, Hack something. Roll if needed.                                         |
| Manipulate Scene | Fiddle with something in the scene to try and improve positioning, or add an exploitable detail. Roll if needed.                             |
| Recover          | Do something to remove a Condition. Put pressure on a bleeding wound, shake off a stunning blow, etc.                                        |
<br/>
- **GM Advice:** When players roll a check to attack NPCs, ask the player how they would like the outcome of that check to manifest.
- **For Example:** 
<br/>- On a Major Success, do they want to inflict a Level Two Wound, or a Level One Wound + Condition? <br/>- On a Minor Success, do they want to inflict a Level One Wound or a Condition?

<br/>
#### Reacting
**Reacting is any action taken in response to an action taken against a PC. Some examples include:**
| Reaction           | Example Resolution                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Block/Defend/Dodge | Roll a Check. Levels of success mean taking less, or no conditions/wounds.                                  |
| Parry/Counter      | Roll a Check. Levels of success mean taking full/less conditions/wounds, but also dealing damage in return. |
| Use Gear/Aug       | Use a feature of gear or an augmentation. Roll if needed.                                                   |
| Resist             | Attempt to stay on your feet after an earth-shaking explosion. Break free of a grapple.                     |

---

#### Turn Orders
**Player Turns in Combat have no strict order. The GM and Players must work together to ensure that each player involved in the scene gets a chance to act.**

**Some general guidance here:**
- Most of the time, you'll follow the fiction. Which character would logically act now?
- If it is unclear, or that character has already acted recently, pick a different character. Decide as a group.
- If a Player hasn't had a chance to Act or React yet, they act. Be sure to share the spotlight.

<p class="text-center">**Remember: Even non-acting players, and characters far from the action can contribute with checks to create opportunities, improve position, and otherwise assist the acting player.<br/><br/> Be open to suggestions, and resolve these first.**</p>

---

### Armour
**Wearing Armour provides two major benefits:**
- **+<AD/> to checks relating to Blocking/Defending** <br/> - When rolling to Defend in combat, you can add additional <AD/> as part of the [Advantages of your Armour](/rustpnk/docs/arules/gearsystem).
- **Armour Track** - See Below

<br/>
#### Armour Track
Armour also provides a Track that increases as you equip Armour. Each piece of Armour will state how much of an increase it provides.

<p class="text-center">**Players can opt to mark their Armour Track to reduce the consequences of a hit by one level per Armour spent.**<br/>Trauma -> Level Two Wound -> Level One Wound -> Condition -> No Damage</p>

---

### Weapons
<p class="text-center">**All Weapons are equally as deadly.**</p>

Instead of variable damage, each class of weapon has its own [Advantages and Disadvantages](/rustpnk/docs/etables/gear), listed beside them. 
- The best weapon is whichever one best fits the context, and the one you have the most skill with.
- **For Example:**<br/>- Short Melee weapons excel for quiet, close-range, intimate work. <br/>- Blades might make a target bleed.<br/>-Shotguns and auto-rifles can potentially hit multiple targets.

---

### NPC Stats
**Much like PCs, NPCs can suffer Conditions, Wounds, and Trauma.**

However, NPCs track these things slightly differently. In addition, they also have a **Toughness** Rating, explained below.

#### Toughness
All NPCs have a [Toughness Rating](/rustpnk/docs/etables/threats). This rating serves to abstract more granular statistics:

<div class="sonohead">
|                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Armour            | Instead of tracking Armour for each NPC, the advantage of it is simply factored into their Toughness.<br/> NPCs cannot mark Armour to soak injuries the same way that PCs can.                                                  |
| Threat            | Their relative Threat (combat stats, mobility, resilience etc.) is factored into Toughness.<br/> **Players add** <TD/> **equal to the Threat's Toughness to any checks made against them.**                                     |
| Maximum Wounds    | Instead of tracking individual, descriptive Wounds, the GM can simply tally up the total number an NPC has taken and compare it with their Maximum Wounds.<br/> **An NPCs Maximum Wounds is equal to their Base Toughness x2.** |
| Current Condition | As they suffer harm, their effectiveness will be reduced. <br/> **Toughness is reduced by 1 for every 4 Wounds they suffer.**                                                                                                   |
</div>


---

#### Conditions
Conditions function the same as they do for PCs. The NPC can have any number of them, and the players gain <AD/> in checks against them if they choose to exploit them.

<br/>
#### Wounds
**For ease of book-keeping, Wounds are tracked in a more abstract way:**
- Keep a tally for each NPC.
- Each time an NPC suffers a Wound, add one or two tallies, depending on the severity of the wound.<br/> (Level One = 1 | Level Two = 2)
- Once an NPC reaches their maximum number of Wounds (Base Toughness x2), they suffer a Trauma.
- Reduce an NPCs Toughness by 1 for every 4 Wounds (tallies).

<br/>
#### Trauma
A typical, regular enemy can only ever suffer a single Trauma.

- Once they do, they've been dealt with, definitively.
- Elite/Boss level enemies might be able to suffer 2 Trauma before succumbing. <br/>- Meaning, they have 2 times the Maximum Wounds of regular enemies.

---

#### Defeating an NPC
In the case of regular enemies, once they suffer a single Trauma, they have been defeated.

However, this doesn't mean that death is the only way to stop an NPC. 

**At the GMs discretion:**
- An enemy suffering over 50% of their Max Wounds, and/or facing overwhelming odds may attempt to bargain for their lives, or simply run away.
- Suffering a single devastating blow (explosion, throat slit, shot to the head) might be enough to finish them off in a single check.

Generally, follow the fiction. Zoom in on the fights that are interesting, but feel free to play smaller encounters fast and loose.

---

#### NPC Features
Like Gear and Augs, NPCs might have features; actions and special moves they can trigger a number of times per combat.

These moves typically allow them to do something special when a PC suffers consequences while Reacting to it.

See [Threats](/rustpnk/docs/etables/threats) for a list of example moves.
