## Getting Hurt
Instead of a pool of Hit Points, characters suffer **Conditions, Wounds, and Traumas**.

### Conditions
<p class="text-center">**Conditions are temporary afflictions.**<br/> Physical, Situational, or Psychological problems that cause trouble in the short-term.
<br/>When a Condition is relevant to a check being made, it adds +1 Threat Dice <TD/> to the pool.
<br/>There is no limit to the number of Conditions you can have a time.</p>
<br/>

- Conditions typically go away on their own after some time, or can be treated with simple actions.<br/> - **For Example:** Moving away from the source of the problem, applying pressure to a wound, etc.
- If not dealt with, a Condition could be compounded upon to become a Level 1 Wound.<br/> - **For Example:** Bleeding -> Minor Bloodloss, or Drained -> Tired.
- In the right context, a condition could also be a positive, adding Advantage Dice <AD/> to checks.<br/> - **For Example:** Drunk/High and resisting pain.

<br/>
**Example Conditions:**
| Condition   | Example Effect                                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bleeding    | You're visibly bloodied, <TD/> to Influence.<br/> Likely to become a Level 1 Wound if not dealt with.                     |
| Burning     | Doing most things while ignited is going to be difficult, <TD/>.<br/> Likely to become a Level 1 Wound if not dealt with. |
| Drugged     | Whatever you took, it's kicking in. <TD/> if the effect of the drug would hinder your action.                             |
| Drunk       | You're stumbling around, <TD/> to Mobility, Dodging.<br/> Your nerves are numbed, <AD/> to Resisting Pain                 |
| Panicking   | You can't even think straight, let alone shoot. <TD/> to Shooting, Thinking.                                              |
| Pinned Down | Under suppressive fire. <TD/> when trying to move or aim from your current location.<br/>                                 |
| Stunned     | Reeling from a strong blow. <TD/> to Awareness, Shooting, Dodge.                                                          |

<p class="text-center">The Conditions and Effects in the table above are purely examples. <br/>Follow the fiction and only apply <AD/>/<TD/> when it makes sense.</p>

---

### Wounds
<p class="text-center">**Wounds are specific, longer-lasting Injuries**
<br/>Wounds can be Minor (Level One), or Severe (Level Two).
<br/>Once per Scene, per Wound, the GM can invoke the Wound to add +1 <TD/> per level of the Wound.<br/>The Wound must be relevant/hindering to the Check being made.</p>


#### Minor Wounds (Level One)
<br/><p class="text-center"> **Minor Wounds are the logical step up from Conditions.**</p><br/>

- Minor Wounds are removed when Recovering during Downtime.
- During a Job, in a moment of brief respite, Minor Wounds can be treat with First-Aid and/or the right gear.
- There are no hard-limits to Minor Wounds, however, if you ever take the same, or similar one twice, it becomes a Severe (Level Two) Wound.

<br/>
<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Minor Wounds:**
| Wound                    |                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Black Eye                | Dislocated [Finger/Shoulder] |
| Bullet Graze             | Sprained [Joint]             |
| Concussion               | Fractured [Bone]             |
| Minor [Burns/Poisoning]  | Torn Muscle                  |
| Shallow [Cut/Stab Wound] | Cracked [Bone]               |
</div>

<br/>
#### Severe Wounds (Level Two)
<br/><p class="text-center"> **Severe Wounds are serious injuries, on track to becoming life-threatening.**</p><br/>

- Severe Wounds require medical attention during Downtime. Recovery in this way turns them into Minor Wounds.
- During a Job, in a moment of brief respite, Severe Wounds might be treatable with First-Aid and the right gear, either reducing or removing them.
- **Unlike Conditions and Minor Wounds, you can only have at most 3 different Level Two Wounds.**<br/> - This limit can be increased by Augmentation. <br/> - If ever you need to write a Severe Wound, but all your boxes are full, immediately write a Trauma instead.

<br/>
<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Severe Wounds:**
| Wound                        |                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Broken [Limb]                | Shattered [Joint/Bone] |
| Bullet Wound                 | Internal Bleeding      |
| Fractured Skull              | Organ Damage           |
| Severe [Bloodloss/Poisoning] | Deep [Cut/Stab Wound]  |
</div>

---

### Trauma
<p class="text-center">**Traumas are desperate, life-threatening injuries.**<br/> Traumas **always** add +2 <TD/> to checks.</p>

<br/>
- Traumas require serious medical attention during Downtime. Recovery this way turns them into Severe Wounds.
- During a job, Traumas can only be temporarily mitigated at best, enabled by specialist medical gear and augmentations.
- **You can have at most 2 different Traumas at a time.**<br/> - Upon filling your last Trauma box, you are **Lost**.<br/> - This limit can be increased by Augmentation.

<div class="loose sonohead">
**Example Trauma:**
| Wound              |                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Severed [Limb]     | Punctured [Vital Organ] |
| Massive Blood Loss | Organ Failure           |
| Brain Haemorrhage  | Paralysis               |
| 4th Degree Burns   | Crushed Chest           |
</div>

<br/>
#### Incapacitation
<p class="text-center">**When writing a new Trauma, you must immediately make the following Check to avoid being incapacitated.**</p>

- Add <AD/> for Toughness, or any other skill with expertise that provides resistance to pain and trauma.
- Add 1 <TD/> as a base.
- Add 1 <TD/> for each current Trauma and Condition.
- Add 1 <TD/> if you are currently within a dangerous environment that is actively harming you (toxins, fire, etc.)

<p/>
- **On a Major or Minor Success:** You persist and stay standing.
- **On a Hollow Success or Bane:** You succumb and fall to the floor, incapacitated.

While incapacitated, you require assistance from an ally soon, or else you will become **Lost**.<br/>
Use common sense to judge how long "soon" is. At most its the end of the scene, or a little longer than that.
<br/>

### Becoming Lost
<p class="text-center">**Signal Terminated**<br/>This dangerous life finally caught up to you.</p>



**Becoming "Lost" could mean a number of things:**
- **If it makes sense, and the player and GM agree, you die.** <br/> - Either immediately, or very soon. <br/> - You might get a check to do something heroic, and a last breath to say something dramatic.
- **You fall into a Coma.** <br/> - You aren't *dead*, but you ain't coming back any time soon, and not without life-changing issues.
- **Physically/Mentally Devastated** <br/> - By some cruel twist of fate, you're alive, but is that truly the better outcome?
- **M.I.A.** <br/> - Your crew lost sight of you in the chaos. You might not be dead, but you never made it back.

<br/>
<p class="text-center">**At an appropriate moment, either immediately, or at the end of the session, the Player or the GM narrate a brief vignette, depicting (or alluding to..) the fate of the character.**</p>
<br/>

---

### And yet you persist..
<p class="text-center">**A character who is lost doesn't have to be gone for good.** <br/>The GM and the Player discuss options and come to a satisfactory compromise.</p>

**If it makes sense, the character may be able to return in some form:**
- **As an NPC, likely much later on, potentially as a shell of their former selves.**<br/> - The GM takes control of your character, but you might be allowed to speak for them in specific scenarios.
- **As a PC, but only after significant time and recovery, and with a permanent debuff.** <br/> - You won't be able to play as them while they recover. You might be able to do brief vignettes involving them during Downtime, if their whereabouts are known, but they're fully out of action otherwise.
<br/> **When they return, you have a new, and highly intrusive Flaw:** <br/> - Phantom Pains from a missing limb, visible and obvious burns/scarring, a personality disorder, panic attacks, etc. 
<br/> **You have one fewer Trauma boxes.**
<br/> - No amount of recovery will get you back to your former strength.
<br/> **Your luck is used up.**
<br/> - The next time you become lost, it's **[Game Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_j8W-SDefU)**.

## Combat

### Momentum
Whichever side currently has "**Momentum**" gets to control the action. 

**At the start of Combat:**
- Decide a Turn Order for Players. (E.g. Flip a coin, heads is Clockwise, tails is Counter-Clockwise).
- Roll 1d6.
    - **On a 1-3:** The enemies start with Momentum and will act first.
    - **On a 4-6:** The characters will start with Momentum, and will act first.
    - **SURPRISE:** If one side gets the drop on the other, they immediately take a turn. Roll for initiative **after** they complete their surprise actions.

<br/>
Whoever has **Momentum** gets to act, and Momentum **swaps back and forth with the flow of Successes and Failures**.

**The Players roll every check**, either making an active move against the enemy, or reacting to a move made against them. 

- **On a Success:** Momentum remains with or shifts to the players. The next player in the turn order gets to declare an action.
- **On a Partial Success:** As a partial consequence or benefit, Momentum *could* shift either way.
- **On a Fail:** Momentum remains with or shifts to the enemies. 

If you find yourself caught in a spiral of failures, the currently acting player can **spend a Stunt Point to Seize Momentum for the players**. See [Stunt Points](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks#stunt-points).

The player who spent the Stunt Point gets to act first. After they act (assuming they Succeed), move on to the next player in the original Turn Order.



<br/>

### Attacking
When **attacking an enemy**, describe what you do and **make a check**.

A **Success** or **Partial Success** causes Harm to the target based on the type of weapon used (See [Gear](/rustpnk/docs/arules/gear)). **Boons** can be spent to cause **additional hits**.

If the intent is to knock down, stun, trap or inflict some other **Condition**, describe how you do it and make the check. **Certain weapon types have a chance of inflicting Conditions** as part of their **Feature**.

**Partial Successes, Failed attacks and Botches can result in consequences** such as suffering harm back, guns jamming, being knocked down, dazed or trapped, losing a weapon or running out of ammo.
<br/>

#### Unaware Targets
When attacking an unaware target, add Action and Danger die related to stealth, along with any die for the attack.
- **On a Boon:** Deal twice as many hits.
- **On a Success:** The target also gains a condition (in addition to any conditions already granted by the weapon.)

---
### Defending
When **targeted by an attack**, describe how you are avoiding or resisting harm and **make a check**.

Different **Trademarks, Edges** and **Tags** will be relevant depending on the approach you choose:
- When **dodging, ducking, weaving and making yourself harder to hit**, tags that increase your **mobility** are going to be useful.
- If attempting to **resist, endure, block or deflect an attack**, tags related to **armor**, **toughness** and **durability** are going to come into play.

What happens depends on the result of the check:
- **Success** means you don’t take a hit. 
- **Partial Success** you take reduced harm, or no harm at all, or might suffer some other consequence instead, such as a condition.
- **Failure** means you take the full hit, and possibly another consequence, such as a condition as well.
- **A Botch** results in the character suffering increased damage, or another appropriate consequence.

#### Armour
Wearing Armour grants you two main benefits:
- **Tags** that grant additional **Action Dice** when making **defense checks**. 
<br/>- For example, Security-Grade Armour provides the "Armoured" tag.
- Increases the maximum value of your **Armour Track**. Marking boxes on your Armour track allows you to **soak hits**, one for one. 
<br/>- For example, Security-Grade Armour sets your Armour Track to 2.
<br/>- This represents lucky hits, glancing blows, and taking hits in less lethal areas.

Once your Armour Track fills, the Armour **isn't broken**, it no longer soaks hits, but it still provides Action Die when defending against attacks, and any fictional advantages or disadvantages it may have.

<br/>
---
### NPC Stats

#### Hits
Unlike Player Characters (PCs), **NPCs only have one Hit Track, labelled "Harm"**, which tracks all sources of damage.

**Once it fills, the NPC will either die, pass out, surrender, or attempt to flee.**

#### Toughness
NPCs have an associated **Toughness**, relative to their strength.

When facing off against an NPC, each point of **Toughness** adds one **Danger Die** to the pool. This is in addition to any conditions the player may have, scene tags etc. that might also add Danger Dice. (See: [Skill Checks](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks))

NPC Hit Tracks are split up into groups of 2. **Reduce Toughness by 1 each time a hit brings them below one of these Thresholds.**
An enemy that starts off almost untouchable, will gradually be weakened as the fight goes on.

**As a GM, be up-front about a threat's Toughness rating before players commit to a roll during Combat.** They can back out and try a different strategy if they find themselves outmatched. 

#### Armour
NPC Armour functions differently to PC Armour. 
- NPCs can be Armoured, this is factored into their Toughness Rating.
- NPCs cannot use Armour to soak hits.

#### Trauma
Extremely tough, or reoccurring enemies may also have **Trauma** boxes, the same as PCs.
Typically, upon marking a Trauma, and not dying, the enemy will make an attempt to escape.
