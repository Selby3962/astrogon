## Combat
Combat plays out largely the same as regular gameplay, with the exception of **Momentum**.

### Momentum
While engaged in hostilities with an NPC, Momentum determines when the Players are **Acting** or **Reacting**.

- While the **Players have Momentum**, any Player can take an action, often involving a Check.
- While the **Enemies have Momentum**, any Enemy can take an action, often to force Players to React with a Check.

Momentum passes back and forth with the flow of Successes and Failures.

---

#### Gaining/Maintaining/Losing Momentum
<p class="text-center">**A possible Consequence of a Check could be losing Momentum.**<br/>The enemy takes advantage of an opening, a mistake, or some other opportunity to strike back.</p>

**Examples:**
- **Gaining Momentum:** An NPC attacks a PC. The PC rolls to dodge and roll a Minor Success.<br/> They suffer a condition, but use their partial success to take back Momentum, shifting control back to the Players.
- **Losing Momentum:** A PC attacks an NPC, they roll a Minor Success. <br/>They deal damage, but as a consequence, the Enemy gets a chance to Act. The PC must now React or suffer.
- **Maintaining Momentum:** A PC Attacks an NPC, they roll a Minor Success. <br/> They deal less damage, but maintain Momentum. Another Player gets a chance to Act.

<p class="text-center">It is up to the GM to decide when the outcome of a roll shifts Momentum.<br/> Follow the fiction, and treat it as an [Advantage/Consequence](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks#advantages--consequences) like any other check.</p>

<br/>
#### Seize Momentum
If the Players find themselves caught in a spiral of failures, any player can spend an [Action Point](/rustpnk/docs/arules/skill-checks) to **Seize Momentum**.
- The Player who spent the point describes what they do to disrupt the flow, and create a momentary distraction, or opportunity.
- Momentum shifts back to the Players. <br/> - The player who spends the point decides who gets to Act.<br/> - Losing Momentum is unavailable as a Consequence for this first check.

---

#### Acting
**Acting is any active action taken by a Player Character. Some examples include:**
| Action           | Example Resolution                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attack           | Roll a Check. Success could mean dealing conditions and wounds of increasing effectiveness.                                                  |
| Disarm           | Roll A Check. Major Success knocks the Enemy's weapon from their hands. Minor or Hollow might put you and/or the target in a worse position. |
| Reposition       | Spend time getting into a more advantageous position, adding <AD/> to later checks.                                                          |
| Talk             | Roll a Check. Attempt diplomacy or intimidation, possibly inflicting a condition.                                                            |
| Use Gear/Aug     | Use a feature of gear or an augmentation. Throw a Grenade, Use Meds, Hack something. Roll if needed.                                         |
| Manipulate Scene | Fiddle with something in the scene to try and improve positioning, or add an exploitable detail. Roll if needed.                             |
| Recover          | Do something to remove a Condition. Put pressure on a bleeding wound, shake off a stunning blow, etc.                                        |
<br/>
- **GM Advice:** When players roll a check to attack NPCs, ask the player how they would like the outcome of that check to manifest.
- **For Example:** 
<br/>- On a Major Success, do they want to inflict a Level Two Wound, or a Level One Wound + Condition? <br/>- On a Minor Success, do they want to inflict a Level One Wound or a Condition?

<br/>
#### Reacting
**Reacting is any action taken in response to an action taken against a PC. Some examples include:**
| Reaction           | Example Resolution                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Block/Defend/Dodge | Roll a Check. Levels of success mean taking less, or no conditions/wounds.                                  |
| Parry/Counter      | Roll a Check. Levels of success mean taking full/less conditions/wounds, but also dealing damage in return. |
| Use Gear/Aug       | Use a feature of gear or an augmentation. Roll if needed.                                                   |
| Resist             | Attempt to stay on your feet after an earth-shaking explosion. Break free of a grapple.                     |

#### Turn Orders
**Player Turns in Combat have no strict order. The GM and Players must work together to ensure that each player involved in the scene gets a chance to act.**

**Some general guidance here:**
- Most of the time, you'll follow the fiction. Which character would logically act now?
- If it is unclear, or that character has already acted recently, pick a different character. Decide as a group.
- If a Player hasn't had a chance to Act or React yet, they act. Be sure to share the spotlight.

<p class="text-center">**Remember: Even non-acting players, and characters far from the action can contribute with checks to create opportunities, improve position, and otherwise assist the acting player.<br/><br/> Be open to suggestions, and resolve these first.**</p>

---

### Armour
**Wearing Armour provides two major benefits:**
- **+<AD/> to checks relating to Blocking/Defending** <br/> - When rolling to Defend in combat, you can add additional <AD/> as part of the [Advantages of your Armour](/rustpnk/docs/arules/gearsystem).
- **Armour Track** - See Below

<br/>
#### Armour Track
Armour also provides a Track that increases as you equip Armour. Each piece of Armour will state how much of an increase it provides.

<p class="text-center">**Players can opt to mark their Armour Track to reduce the consequences of a hit by one level per Armour spent.**<br/>Trauma -> Level Two Wound -> Level One Wound -> Condition -> No Damage</p>

---

### Weapons
<p class="text-center">**All Weapons are equally as deadly.**</p>

Instead of variable damage, each class of weapon has its own [Advantages and Disadvantages](/rustpnk/docs/etables/gear), listed beside them. 
- The best weapon is whichever one best fits the context, and the one you have the most skill with.
- **For Example:**<br/>- Short Melee weapons excel for quiet, close-range, intimate work. <br/>- Blades might make a target bleed.<br/>-Shotguns and auto-rifles can potentially hit multiple targets.

---

### NPC Stats
**Much like PCs, NPCs can suffer Conditions, Wounds, and Trauma.**

However, NPCs track these things slightly differently. In addition, they also have a **Toughness** Rating, explained below.

#### Toughness
All NPCs have a [Toughness Rating](/rustpnk/docs/etables/threats). This rating serves to abstract more granular statistics:

<div class="sonohead">
|                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Armour            | Instead of tracking Armour for each NPC, the advantage of it is simply factored into their Toughness.<br/> NPCs cannot mark Armour to soak injuries the same way that PCs can.                                                  |
| Threat            | Their relative Threat (combat stats, mobility, resilience etc.) is factored into Toughness.<br/> **Players add** <TD/> **equal to the Threat's Toughness to any checks made against them.**                                     |
| Maximum Wounds    | Instead of tracking individual, descriptive Wounds, the GM can simply tally up the total number an NPC has taken and compare it with their Maximum Wounds.<br/> **An NPCs Maximum Wounds is equal to their Base Toughness x2.** |
| Current Condition | As they suffer harm, their effectiveness will be reduced. <br/> **Toughness is reduced by 1 for every 4 Wounds they suffer.**                                                                                                   |
</div>

#### Conditions
Conditions function the same as they do for PCs. The NPC can have any number of them, and the players gain <AD/> in checks against them if they choose to exploit them.

<br/>
#### Wounds
**For ease of book-keeping, Wounds are tracked in a more abstract way:**
- Keep a tally for each NPC.
- Each time an NPC suffers a Wound, add one or two tallies, depending on the severity of the wound.<br/> (Level One = 1 | Level Two = 2)
- Once an NPC reaches their maximum number of Wounds (Base Toughness x2), they suffer a Trauma.
- Reduce an NPCs Toughness by 1 for every 4 Wounds (tallies).

<br/>
#### Trauma
A typical, regular enemy can only ever suffer a single Trauma.

- Once they do, they've been dealt with, definitively.
- Elite/Boss level enemies might be able to suffer 2 Trauma before succumbing. <br/>- Meaning, they have 2 times the Maximum Wounds of regular enemies.

---

#### Defeating an NPC
In the case of regular enemies, once they suffer a single Trauma, they have been defeated.

However, this doesn't mean that death is the only way to stop an NPC. 

**At the GMs discretion:**
- An enemy suffering over 50% of their Max Wounds, and/or facing overwhelming odds may attempt to bargain for their lives, or simply run away.
- Suffering a single devastating blow (explosion, throat slit, shot to the head) might be enough to finish them off in a single check.

Generally, follow the fiction. Zoom in on the fights that are interesting, but feel free to play smaller encounters fast and loose.

---

#### NPC Features
Like Gear and Augs, NPCs might have features; actions and special moves they can trigger a number of times per combat.

These moves typically allow them to do something special when a PC suffers consequences while Reacting to it.

See [Threats](/rustpnk/docs/etables/threats) for a list of example moves.
