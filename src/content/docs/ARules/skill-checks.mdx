## What are checks?

When a character's course of action is dangerous or uncertain, make a check. <br/>
Create a pool of **Action** (⛊) and **Danger** (⛉) dice; 6-sided dice in two different colours.

**To start, tell everyone what your Character is doing.**<br/>
**Describe their action, what you want to achieve, and how your character is going about it.**

**Then:**
## Create a Dice Pool

**Start with one Action die.** Add further **Action** and **Danger** die based on the situation. Anyone can make suggestions, but the GM has final say.

#### Add One Action Die ⛊ for:
- **Trademark:** A single relevant trademark. Make an argument for why it is useful.
- **Edges:** Each relevant edge attached to the trademark being used.
- **Enemy Tags:** Each Tag on an enemy that can be exploited for an advantage.
- **Position:** Having better position, acting on a careful plan, assistance from an ally, or having plenty of time to prepare.
- **Scene tags:** Any relevant environmental detail you can exploit for advantage.
- **Gear:** Each relevant tag you have on gear or Augs.

#### Add One Danger Die ⛉ for:
- **Trauma:** Each trauma a character has, even if it is not related to the current action being attempted.
- **Conditions:** Each relevant condition you have.
- **Enemy Toughness:** Add dice equal to the Toughness rating of the enemy you're facing. Higher if an enemy is bigger, tougher, more skilled, or especially powerful.
- **Position:** The enemy has better position, you're being rushed, surprised or unprepared.
- **Scene Tags:** Any relevant environmental detail that hinders your actions.
- **Gear:** Not having the right gear. Some actions may be impossible.

#### Helping
- If one or more allies are assisting you, add 1⛊. This is factored into "**Position**".
- Allies can also lend additional dice to your pool by manipulating the scene, usually involving a Check of their own. (i.e. disabling the lights, activating the sprinkler system, etc.)

## Roll the Dice
- Each Danger Die ⛉ cancels out an Action Die ⛊ with a matching number. Discard both.
- Find your highest remaining Action Die ⛊. This is your result.

## The Result 
- **6: Success.** You do what you set out to do. If you have multiple 6's left, gain a **"boon"**. (See "Boons", below)
- **4 or 5: Partial Success.** You achieve your goal, but at a price. Perhaps you don't achieve everything you wanted, maybe the action cost you something, or the situation is made worse. A consequence is applied.
- **3 or Less: Failure.** You don't succeed. Things have gone poorly, the action failed and you might find yourself in a worse position. A consequence is applied.
- **BOTCH:** If all Action Dice have been cancelled out, or the only remaining Action Dice are 1's, you have critically failed. Things have gone very wrong, and the consequences will likely be severe.

**Whatever happens, describe the outcome of the check, using the result to guide the fiction and move the story along.**

#### Boons
Rolling Multiple 6's grants you a **"Boon"**. "You Succeeded, *and also..*".

**Boons are used immediately, and can be spent one of three ways:**
- **Greater Effect:** Deal/Resist +1 hit per boon. Spend one to inflict a condition. Affect additional targets. etc.
- **Create an Advantage:** Improve your success even more. Add or remove a tag from the scene, make more progress toward a goal.
- **Set up an Ally:** Describe how your action helps set up another character in the current scene. They gain 1⛊ if they take advantage of it.

## Extended Checks
Sometimes one roll isn't enough to overcome particularly complex problems, multiple players may need to work together to make progress toward these goals.

In these instances the GM might call for an "Extended Check". These typically take the form of a "Clock".
Clocks are an easy visual way to display progress toward an Extended Check. 

Draw a circle, and split it up into segments. Each time a player makes a check, fill in segments based on the result. The more segments a clock has, the more successes players will need to overcome it.

If the Clock fills, the check is a success.

**For example:**
- For each **Success**, mark one or two segments. 
- For each **Partial**, mark one or zero segments. 
- For **Fails**, mark no segments.
- **Boons** and **Botches** might add additional segments, or even remove segments to represent backward progress.

Clocks are also handy for representing the push and pull of two opposing sides in a conflict.

**For example:**
- Draw a clock with an even number of segments, and fill in half of them straight away.
- Fill in or erase segments as the two sides make moves against each other.
- One side wins if the clock fills, the other wins if the clock empties.


## Consequences
When a check is made, something happens. We call these consequences. When an action succeeds, the character does whatever they were trying to do. 

Partial success and failure also have consequences that fit with whatever was being attempted. If a character was trying to leap from one rooftop to another a partial success might see them hanging by their fingertips, while a failure could result in them taking a great fall. 

**Always refer back to the fiction being created and do what makes sense.**

#### Example Consequences:
- **COST:** The action costs something. Perhaps time is wasted, an item of gear is lost or broken, or a resource is used up.
- **COMPLICATION:** Make a revelation that increases the pressure. Make it unexpected, or something the characters did not want to be true.
- **TAGS:** The scene changes in some way, probably for the worse. Add or remove a tag from a character, enemy or the scene itself.
- **THREATS:** Add a new threat to the scene, or increase the power or scale of an existing problem or enemy.
- **HARM:** A character suffers a physical, mental, social or emotional injury. It might be the acting character, or an innocent bystander.
- **TICK A CLOCK:** Add a tick to a clock, which could represent time running out, the target going to ground, or security going on high alert.

**You can mix, match and combine consequences. Do what fits the story.**

## Stunt Points
Stunt points are a resource you can spend during a job to **improve your chances of success**. 

**A character can spend a stunt point to do one of the following:**

##### Use a Second Trademark
- Spend a Stunt Point to **use two relevant Trademarks instead of one** (and any of their relevant edges) in a check. 
- You can never use more than two Trademarks in a check.

##### Seize Momentum
- Spend a Stunt Point to take control away from the enemies during Combat. See [Momentum](/rustpnk/docs/arules/combat-harm-healing#momentum)
- After rolling a check during Combat, regardless of the outcome, you can spend a Stunt point to seize or maintain Momentum for the players.
- The player who spent the Stunt Point gets to act first. After they act (assuming they Succeed), move on to the next player in the original Turn Order.

##### Make a Declaration
- Spend a Stunt Point to **add a useful detail and/or tag to the scene.** 
- This cannot contradict any already-established fact, and the GM still has final say.
- This could also take the form of a Flashback.

##### Change an Action Die
- Spend a Stunt Point to change an Action Die up or down by one result. **You could turn a 5 into a 6, or a 3 into a 4, for example.**
- Do this after a roll, but before cancelling with Danger Dice. **You can spend multiple Stunt Points to alter a die by several results.**

#### Refreshing Stunt Points
- **A character begins each job with a fully refreshed stunt point pool.** Once a job begins stunt points can only be regained by facing adversity.
- **When one of a character’s flaws causes significant trouble**, harm or problems for themselves or an ally, **all used stunt points are regained**, up to their starting maximum. **This can happen once per-job.**
- At the GM ’s discretion, **a character who does something cool**, dramatic or just plain awesome **can be rewarded with a single stunt point**. This is a great reward for roleplaying and playing to genre. **This cannot take you above your Stunt Point Maximum**.
