# Background

In the distant future of 2180, humanity have transformed the once desolate and uninhabitable surface of Mars. 

With conditions on Earth deteriorating by the hour, people leapt at the chance to flee the rapid and inevitable death of the planet. Corporations took advantage of this desperation, leading to the mass-relocation known as [The Exodus](/docs/dothertopics/history).

The transformation of Mars from a barren wasteland into a liveable planet took decades of relentless scientific endeavour. 
Advanced atmospheric manipulation, greenhouse gas injection, the restoration of Mars' ancient oceans, and the introduction of hardy plant life created a sustainable atmosphere and a semblance of Earth-like conditions. 

Now, Mars boasts sprawling urban landscapes, towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and an array of ecosystems reminiscent of old Earth.
