# Background

<div class="text-justify">
In the distant future of 2180, humanity have transformed the once desolate and uninhabitable surface of Mars. 
Now, Mars boasts sprawling urban landscapes, towering skyscrapers, bustling streets, and an array of ecosystems reminiscent of old Earth.

**RUST/PNK takes place in the martian harbour city of Wuhai, a blood-soaked cross of Hong Kong, Las Vegas, and Tokyo.**
</div>

<div class="text-justify">
Ecological collapse played a major role in the destruction of Old Earth, and now, the manufactured climate of Mars hangs in a perpetually perilous state. The Red Sea, the restored ancient oceans and their closely monitored ecosystems, along with vast networks of Climate Control towers, work overtime to sustain all life on the planet.

**Mars is Humanityâ€™s last and only chance of survival. Best not fuck it up.**
