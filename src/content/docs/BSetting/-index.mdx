# Background

<div class="text-justify">
In the distant future of 2180, humanity have transformed the once desolate and uninhabitable surface of Mars. 
<br/>Now, Mars boasts sprawling urban landscapes and an ecosystem reminiscent of old Earth.
</div>

<div class="text-justify">
Ecological collapse played a major role in the destruction of Old Earth, and now, the manufactured climate of Mars hangs in a perpetually perilous state.<br/> The Red Sea, the restored ancient oceans and their closely monitored ecosystems, along with vast networks of Climate Control towers, work overtime to sustain all life on the planet. 
</div>
<div class="text-center">
**Mars is Humanityâ€™s last and only chance of survival. Best not fuck it up.**
