## Wuhai

Wuhai is a sin-soaked cross between Hong Kong, Las Vegas, and New York City, a maritime megacity, situated on the coast of the Masursky Bay, formed by the now-flooded Masursky meteor impact site, and surrounded on all other sides by The Expanse of Mars' vast, red desert.

Originally a mining colony in the earliest days of Martian colonisation, modern-day Wuhai is a wholely unique organism, a thriving, independent city-state. A melting pot of cultures and interests, and a major commercial and cultural hub that facilitates trade across the planet.

Wuhai, like many similar settings, is a city of contrasts: the sleek corporate towers of the Zaitan District versus the lawless chaos and unknown of the Kamaga Dark Zone; the high-tech lifestyle of the wealthy elite juxtaposed with the harsh realities faced by those who eke out a living in The Expanse.

While internal factions fight for control of Wuhai's streets, the city also finds itself caught in the crossfire of an ever-present cold-war between neighbouring Nations, eager to exploit its unique strategic position.

## Districts of Wuhai

### Awanaka Industrial Zone - Heavy Industry
{/* <Accordion client:load title="Show/Hide"> */}

    <Tab name="Background">

    #### Demographic

    - **Wealth** ★☆☆☆☆ 
    - **Security** ★★★☆☆ 
    - **Corp-Influence** ★★★☆☆ 
    - **Gang-Influence** ★★☆☆☆

    #### Background

    The Awanaka Industrial Zone lies to the north-east of Wuhai. The sprawling expanse of smokestacks, factories, and foundries spewing endless chemical effluvia are a grim testament to the heavy toll of unchecked progress.

    At the heart of the industrial zone looms the ShinMaywa Nuclear Power Station (or simply "The ShinWa Station"), providing energy to Wuhai and its surrounding regions. Its looming cooling towers and dense web of pipes and conduits dominate the landscape for miles around.

    When the wind blows in the wrong direction, pollutants from the foundries are cast across vast swathes of Wuhai's East Side. Pollutants include aluminium, carbon dioxide, sulphur trioxide, sulphuric acid, e-coli, and sodium chloride, to name just a few.

    Augmentation can help to counteract the hostile environment of Awanaka, not that those who live and work in the danger-zone can afford such luxuries. Matter of fact, some of the labourers wear their lack of protective augmentations as a point of pride, an attitude not discouraged by the corporate propaganda machine.

    #### Scene
    Flames spew from mile-high smokestacks. The skies are shrouded in a perpetual haze. Sinuses on fire; the air is so thick with pollutants you can taste it. The ShinWa Station's monolithic cooling towers loom overhead, blotting out the sun, leaving most of the district in darkness.

### Central - Old Colony & Administration

    <Tab name="Background">

    #### Demographic

    - **Wealth** ★★★☆☆ 
    - **Security** ★★★☆☆ 
    - **Corp-Influence** ★★★☆☆ 
    - **Gang-Influence** ★★★☆☆

    #### Background
    The Central District of Wuhai is the epicentre of academia, transport, and government.

    The heart of the Colony in the earliest days of colonisation. Now, outside of the narrow lanes of Komorebi Arcade, there are virtually no signs of the prefab units and habitations that were once the totality of Wuhai.

    Wuhai's halls of governance are stacked around the Administrative Sector. Here, the poorly oiled machinery of city management grinds away, vainly attempting to maintain influence over a city that has long since sold control to the highest bidder.

    #### Scene
    The ground shakes as a metro train tears past on the overhead metro line. A washed up politician preaches in futility to the throng of uninterested corporate drones who filter along the main street. A group of students tumble out from the narrow streets of Komorebi Arcade, one of them has a traffic cone on their head. 
    </Tab>

    <Tab name="Notables">
    #### People
    ##### ..

    #### Places
    ##### The Administration Sector
    - **City Hall:** City Hall stands as the beating heart of Wuhai's government. Or so they say. In reality, this building is more symbol than substance, with decisions largely made in corporate boardrooms, behind closed doors.
    - **Wuhai Central Court**: With most cases handled remotely, with verdicts delivered by an AI jury, the Central Court's grand chambers are a glorified reality TV set, reserved for high-profile cases only.
    - **Embassies**: Home to embassies of the various Martian nations.


    ##### Komorebi Arcade
    - Komorebi Arcade offers a rare glimpse into the city's history. Originally designed as the recreational heart of the colony, the Arcade is a labyrinth of narrow, covered streets and alleys, many of which still comprised (at least partially) of prefabricated units. Here, small bars, quirky shops, and the modest offices of local businesses line the lanes.

    ##### Nakayama University
    - Not far from Komorebi Arcade, stands Nakayama University. This exclusive institution, funded by the Nakayama Corporation, boasts a sprawling campus renowned for its excellence in engineering and biological sciences. Part of the birth to boardroom pipeline.

    ##### Central Station
    - Central Station is Wuhai's main transport hub, connecting to the rest of the city via Metro, and to neighbouring cities via bullet-train. 
    - For more private journeys, ranks of taxis wait to ferry passengers to their destinations via road or, more exclusively, air.

    ##### Cerberus Group Headquarters
    - The imposing, brutalist tombstone of the Cerberus Group Headquarters serves as the public face of security in Wuhai. 
    - From this fortress, the city's private police force coordinate efforts to maintain order.

    ##### Regenesis Medical Centre
    - The Regenesis Medical Centre is the city's largest and most advanced medical care facility. 
    - It's cutting-edge medical technology and highly-qualified staff are available to those with the ₩on to afford medical insurance.

    #### Background
    Daishin Heights is a district of exclusive corporate housing. It's luxury apartments and heavily-guarded streets serving as the ideal place for corporations to protect and monitor their employees.

    The shops and services of the district employ a system of Corporate Credit separate to the ₩on used elsewhere in the city, to ensure that all transactions made within it's walls are carefully tracked and accounted for.
    Employees are typically signed up to a basic subscription plan as part of their contracts that affords access to services to maintain their corporate lifestyles. This subscription comes in four Tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum.

    #### Scene
    Towering glass facades mirror the sky. Too clean streets, holographic foliage, the smell of disinfectant. Soft classical music seeps from a speaker mounted...somewhere? A woman pushes a stroller down the street, she smiles wide at you; a cherubic plastic face stares blankly out at the world from beneath the canopy of the stroller.

    Zaiten is a playground for the corporations who built and run Wuhai. For the privileged few who work in Zaiten, life is a constant whirlwind of power lunches, high-stakes negotiations, and extravagant soirées. 
    
    The district's streets are meticulously clean, patrolled by private security forces and serviced by autonomous vehicles that whisk executives between meetings in comfort and safety.

    However, beneath the veneer of prosperity, corporate rivalries simmer below the surface. Corporate espionage to carefully staged murder, there's little those who inhabit this reality won't do to see numbers go up.

    #### Scene
    Towers of glass and crystal pierce the smog above. Polished shoes clack loudly along polished streets; their owners never running, but always rushing. Cerberus Elite stand at attention on every corner, in immaculate dress uniform.

    #### Background
    The Tenjin Parlor District is the city's largest red-light district. A hive of desire, built around the district's sinuous, vein-like network of canals.

    Those savvy in the ways of the district choose to navigate it by private boat, and know well to avoid the taxi-boat services offered to tourists.

    The Tenjin Parlor District is under the domain of the Arashi Syndicate, a powerful Yakuza family that operates with a strict, and unwavering code.


    #### Scene
    The wake of the small skiff displaces the sultry lights that dance upon the surface of the canal. Small jetties and mooring points on either side grant access to the bright and attractive facades of brothels, clubs, and bars, catering to the niches of all manner of clientele. A cacophony of music leaks from these buildings out into the street. Up ahead, a small bridge cuts across the waterway. A figure, silhouetted by neon light leans over the side of it, then throws up violently into the water.

    Also known as The Strand, the district is teeming with life, commerce, and entertainment. Lavish casinos, theatres, clubs, and vibrant markets line the strand, each one battling for attention.

    #### Scene
    A dozen different holographic advertisements for casinos and clubs seem to chase each other, flowing across facades on all sides, each one brighter and louder than the last. Below and to the right, a sunken market plaza is alive with the flow of shoppers, sellers hawking discount wares, and food sizzling atop open flames. Smells collide; spices, meat, sweat, and oil. A pickpocket's paradise.

    - **Gang-Influence** ★★★★☆

    #### Background

    To the north of Wuhai lies Heng Fa — an industrial, working-class district caught in the cross-fire of a savage gang war. On the streets and waterways of Heng Fa, The Heisei Cartel and The Galyeojin engage in fierce territorial contest.

    Meanwhile, The Arashi Syndicate , operating from the nearby Tenjin District seek to maintain control over the borders of their own territory in a war of attrition with the nearby corporate sector, pushing them ever further into the already-crowded Heng Fa.

    #### Scene
    Gunfire cracks in the distance; multiple short bursts that echo loud and hollow in the narrow alleys between rusted shipping containers. Along the trash-choked Ankoru river, a small tugboat drifts silently along, its deck crew tense, eyes scanning the walkways above. Two kids in patched up jackets seem to sense something, and scurry into the shelter of a nearby noodle shop. Before you know it, a black sedan screeches past, windows down, barrels out..

    - Heisei Cartel, hold an iron grip on the Western side of Heng Fa, and lay claim to two pivotal strongholds.
    - The Heng Fa Docks, a nexus of maritime activity, and a critical lifeline, facilitating the covert transport of goods and contraband.
    - Nearby, the Heng Fa Fishmarket serves as a hub of both legitimate and illegitimate trade.

    ##### Galyeojin Territory
    - On the Eastern front, the Galyeojin establish dominion, centred around the vibrant enclave known as "Little Seoul".
    - The Galyeojin lay claim to the Heng Fa Container Terminal, an important strategic asset, hard-won in their ongoing rivalry with the Heisei Cartel.

    ##### The Battleground
    - The Seaboard that stretches from the Heng Fa Docks in the West to the Heng Fa Container Terminal in the East is a perpetually contested battleground.
    - The Ankoru River that slices through the district is another focal point of conflict. Blocks and tenements along its banks are hotly-contested, and the constant skirmishes for control have turned the streets of this community into a war-zone.
