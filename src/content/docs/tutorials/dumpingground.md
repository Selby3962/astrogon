### Actions
On their turn characters can either:

<br/>*OR*
- **Perform a Focused Action**.

#### Quick Actions include:
- Make an attack

- Throw an ally an object
- Say something no more than a few words

#### Focused Actions include:
- Make a precise shot
- Move far away

##### Soak Hits
- Spend a Stunt Point to **completely negate a single instance of damage** (or other source of harm). (See [Harm & Healing](/docs/arules/combat-harm-healing))
- This must be done when the hits are suffered. Doing so does not undo the action that caused the harm.
